#1(a)
#According to graph,the estimated model equation is ln(π/(1 − π) = −7.0 + 0.1A + 1.2S + 0.3R + 0.2R × S.

#1)The estimated odds ratio for having cancer comparing R = 1 versus R = 0 given S = 0: Odds ˆ (R = 1|S = 0) / Odds ˆ (R = 0|S = 0) = exp(−7.0 + 0.1A + 0.3) / exp(−7.0 + 0.1A) = exp(0.3) = exp(βˆR) = 1.35

#We can conclude that for nonsmokers, the odds for squamous cell esophageal cancer are 35% higher for black than for white people.

#2)The estimated odds ratio for having cancer comparing R = 1 versus R = 0 given S = 1: Odds ˆ (R = 1|S = 1) / Odds ˆ (R = 0|S = 1) = exp(−7.0 + 0.1A + 0.3 + 1.2 + 0.2)/ exp(−7.0 + 0.1A + 1.2) = exp(0.3+0.2) = exp(βˆR+βˆR×S) = 1.65

#We can conclude that for smokers, the odds for squamous cell esophageal cancer are 65% higher for black than for white people.

#3)The estimated odds ratio for having cancer comparing S = 1 versus S = 0 given R = 0: Odds ˆ (S = 1|R = 0) / Odds ˆ (S = 0|R = 0) = exp(−7.0 + 0.1A + 1.2) / exp(−7.0 + 0.1A) = exp(1.2) = exp(βˆS) = 3.32

#We can conclude that for white people, the odds for squamous cell esophageal cancer are 232% higher for smokers than for nonsmokers.

#4)The estimated odds ratio for having cancer comparing S = 1 versus S = 0 given R = 1: Odds ˆ (S = 1|R = 1) / Odds ˆ (S = 0|R = 1) = exp(−7.0 + 0.1A + 1.2 + 0.3 + 0.2) / exp(−7.0 + 0.1A + 0.3) = exp(1.2+0.2) = exp(βˆS+βˆR×S) = 4.01

#We can conclude that for black people, the odds for squamous cell esophageal cancer are 301% higher for smoker than for non-smokers.

#1(b)
#According to part(a), we can see that e^βˆR = e^0.30 = 1.65. There is65% increase in the odds for the cancer for black over white people, if S = 0 (for nonsmokers); e^βˆS = e^1.20 = 3.32, 232% increase in the odds for the cancer for smokers over nonsmokers,if R = 0 (for white people).

#According to the summary, we get that when H0: beta1(D) = 0, the p-value is 0.00931, which D is important predictor of probabilty of the odds of being a patient with general anesthesia experienced a sore throat on waking. Patients who use a laryngeal mask airway are more likely to experience a sore throat.

#1)For tracheal tube T=1: logit(P-hat(Y=1))=-4.42245+0.10308(D)
#2)For laryngeal mask airway T=0: logit(P-hat(Y=1))=0.04979+0.02848(D)
#Therefore,  we can say for a one-unit increase in duration of the surgery, we expect to see about 11% (exp(0.10308)=1.10858) increase in the odds of being a patient with general anesthesia experienced a sore throat on waking, given T=1.
